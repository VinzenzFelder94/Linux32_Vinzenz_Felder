Here are the answers for the Measuring a gpio. 
 
1) Sleeptime = 0.1  U_max= 4.22V  U_min= 3.41V freq= 4.18HZ
 
2) Period is 4.18 HZ
 
3) It is 6 HZ close to 10Hz(100ms) 
 
4)The differ is because the prozess can not be executed as "real-time". There are parallel processes which have a higher priority
 
5) The are using 1 to 3 prozessors, 32 Tasks and up to 60 Threads
 
6) the answer can given through the pdf file
 
7) no stable period. With ./togglegpio.sh it changes due to a exp-function
 
8) The period has now 4.3HZ.
 
9) no not really.
 
10) No changes
 
11) The maxiumum is around 30HZ. Than the CPU is at the maximum of 100%.
